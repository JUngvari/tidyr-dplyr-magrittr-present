This is an R Markdown document for using the packages tidyr, dplyr and magrittr. 
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

First, you should install and load the packages:

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyr", "dplyr", "magrittr")
#library("tidyr", "dplyr", "magrittr"")
```

>>> "tidyr"

tidyr uses just a few functions to easily tidy data. 
It simplifies workflows by piping the results of one function into the next.

There are just a few functions to remember, and their names are really self-explanatory.

expand  - Expand data frame to include all combinations of levels.
extract	- Extract one column into multiple columns.
extract_numeric	- Extract numeric component of variable.
gather	 - Gather columns into key-value pairs.
separate	- Separate one column into multiple columns.
seq_range	- Create an evenly spaced sequence of values from highest to lowest.
spread	- Spread a key-value pair across multiple columns.
spread_	- Standard-evaluation version of 'spread'.
unite	- Unite multiple columns into one.
unnest	- Unnest a list column.
unnest_	- Standard-evaluation version of 'unnest'.


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
